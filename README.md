# Number-Theory

This is an implementation for some famous algorithms Known in Number Theory,
I did that at my senior year at college as an assignment for this subject and got the full mark for it.

This was intended  to be helpful and to actually learn from it so it prints out every single step the algorithm took and made,
it's not about just getting answers but also to understand and learn from it.

1. PRIMES:

    tabulate the number of primes less than x, the number of primes of the form 4k+1 less than x, 
    the number of primes of the form 4k+3 less than x, where x assumes the values 1000, 2000,..., 10000. 
  
2. Solving Linear congurnces

    ax = b (mod m)

3. Chinese remainder theroem 

4. Primitive Pythagorean Triples
